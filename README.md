Repository for documenting the process of creating an ict-project for course ICT-infrastructure project

## Concept

**Have you ever been in a rush, leaving your home and slamming the door shut? Only to realize that you left the most important thing behind that door? Your keys.**

This project tries to tackle that problem. By implementing a RFID reader, Raspberry Pi, a magnetic door sensor and an alarm we can make sure you will save yourself some trouble.
